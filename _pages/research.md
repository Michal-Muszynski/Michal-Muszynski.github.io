My research focuses on the devoplement and application of multimodal deep machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, and statistical methods on vast and various human-centered datasets.

# Applications to Brain Imaging:

We investigate the neural stractures in human brain that are responsible for multiple component processes that are integrated in a dynamic manner to generate emotion episodes, such as appraisal mechanisms that process contextual information on events, as well as motivational, expressive, and physiological mechanisms that orchestrate behavioral manifestations.
In our project, we aim to:
- explore brain networks that mediate different components and appraisals using fMRI, physiological, and behavioral measures during emotional events;
- develop naturalistic elicitation procedures by exploiting aesthetic and emotional movies;
- apply new signal processing and machine learing methods and approaches to uncover the neural representation of emotions.
