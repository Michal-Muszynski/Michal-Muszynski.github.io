I carry out interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science, neuroscience, medicine, and psychology. I received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Geneva in 2018. My research interests are in the areas of multimodal machine learning, affective computing, heathcare informatics, human behavior analysis, multimedia analysis, affective neuroscience,and signal processing. As part of the Neurology & Imaging of Cognition laboratory, I bring my research experience in physiological and behavioural signal analysis and multimodal deep machine learning.
