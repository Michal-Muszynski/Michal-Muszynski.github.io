I am a senior postodoctoral reseacher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. I carry out interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science, neuroscience, medicine, and psychology.
I received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Geneva in 2018. My thesis is available on [the UNIGE archive](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:114609).
My research interests are in the areas of multimodal machine learning, affective computing, healthcare informatics, human behavior analysis, multimedia analysis, affective neuroscience, and signal processing. As a member of [the Neurology & Imaging of Cognition laboratory](https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/patrik-vuilleumier/), I bring my research experience in physiological and behavioural signal analysis and multimodal deep machine learning.
