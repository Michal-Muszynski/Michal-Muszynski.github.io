I am currently a senior data scientist at IBM in Dublin, Ireland, and I am a researcher and engineer with a lot of theoretical background and industrial experience in various applied science and technology domains: healthcare, AI-assisted chemical sensing, remote sensing, and multimedia recommendation systems. I have also authored and co-authored over 40 publications, 2 books, and 2 US patents.

I have co-developed a tunable and reusable [AI foundation model named Prithvi](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-03-IBM-and-NASA-Open-Source-Largest-Geospatial-AI-Foundation-Model-on-Hugging-Face) to analyse petabytes of text and remote-sensing data for mitigation of climate impact on society and businesses in the collaboration between IBM Research and NASA. Furthermore, I have co-developed an [electronic tongue named HyperTaste](https://spectrum.ieee.org/meet-hypertaste-an-ai-assisted-electronic-tongue) to accelerate chemical sensing of complex liquids. In addition, I have co-developed an [integrated chronic disease management platform](https://www.ibm.com/industries/healthcare) supported by wearable sensors with the aim to record patient symptoms continuously, predict and prevent acute events for supporting patients in their everyday activities.

I hold a PhD degree in Computer Science, specialised in emotion recognition of movie spectators and highlight detection in movies, Master’s degree in Robotics, and two Bachelor’s degrees in Robotics and Mathematics. Before joining IBM, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in multimodal machine learning and computer vision at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA.
